        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> I am a 33 year old trans-non-binary person from Seattle Washington. Igot into code at the age of 14 and took classes through out highschool. However, I started working full time at 15 which took up most of my free time. This continued into my adulthood, leaving behind my interest in programing and code. I am always been very interested in computers and video games and what used to be a hobby continued to be a latent interest well into my thirties.</p>
        <p>Recently, there was an opportunity for me to temporarily step away from my current 60+ hour/week job to invest time into University of Washington's Coding Bootcamp. This was a program I had been considering for years but never felt up to the challenge. While the bootcamp is exactly that-- a challenge -- it has also awoken that passion for coding language I had when I was young and I am excited to continue to learn.</p>
