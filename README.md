# Second-Challenge
HW 3.28.23


## Challenge Description ##

Create a portfolio of work that can showcase my abilities and talents for potential employers looking to fill a position. The portfolio should highlight my strongest work and the work/thought process behind them. This portfolio should hold several deployed projects as this in a minimum requirement to receive an interview in many companies. This challenge is to set my future up for success in terms of a career in this industry. 

The portfolio will showcase current pieces of work as well as place holder images to be replaced with completed work at a future date.


## Work Process ##

/* Wire Frame */

For this challenge I started by building out a wire frame of the porfolio outline. This allows me to plan out the base structure and be able to add in CSS for styling elements as I move forward. 

I began with the base of the wire frame using Excalidraw. Included with the wire frame is the tablet and phone views as well as planned details.

/* Base HTML structure */

After my wire frame has been created, I move to adding in basic code structure. We are building this code from scratch and building a solid foundation is the best way to begin.
