# Second-Challenge
HW 3.28.23


## Challenge Description ##

Create a portfolio of work that can showcase my abilities and talents for potential employers looking to fill a position. The portfolio should highlight my strongest work and the work/thought process behind them. This portfolio should hold several deployed projects as this in a minimum requirement to receive an interview in many companies. This challenge is to set my future up for success in terms of a career in this industry. 

The portfolio will showcase current pieces of work as well as place holder images to be replaced with completed work at a future date.


## Work Process ##

/* Wire Frame */

For this challenge I started by building out a wire frame of the porfolio outline. This allows me to plan out the base structure and be able to add in CSS for styling elements as I move forward. 

I began with the base of the wire frame using Excalidraw. Included with the wire frame is the tablet and phone views as well as planned details.


After my wire frame has been created, I move to adding in basic code structure. We are building this code from scratch and building a solid foundation is the best way to begin. I started wih my basic HTML frame work knowing I wanted a header, side bar, and three information boxes for About Me,  Work Examples, and Contact information. I also wanted o include a navigation bar and links to my active pieces of work. 

Once the HMTL had been built, I went into the CSS to begin adding visual details. This included color scheme, text, and utilizing flex boxes to break up the information into different sections. I wanted to ensure these sections retained their properties regardless of screen size and included the @media query as well.
